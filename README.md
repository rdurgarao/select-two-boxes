## Consuming your component library
Once installed, you can import your header component into any application’s app.module.ts, by including it in its @NgModule imports array…

```import { HeaderModule } from 'my-package-name';
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    HeaderModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```
And using its selector in a template as you would a component that is part of your application.
